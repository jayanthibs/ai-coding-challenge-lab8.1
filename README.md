Where AI saved time.

AI saved time by quickly creating basic code, helping find and fix errors, and guiding feature implementation, which reduced manual effort and sped up development.

At least one AI bug you identified and how you fixed it.

One AI bug was that the card wouldn’t flip. I fixed it by manually updating the code to toggle the flip class, so the card flips correctly.

A code snippet you refactored for clarity.

I moved the “New Deck” button from the sidebar to the header so it’s easier to see and use.

One accessibility improvement you added.

I made the app accessible by adding aria attributes to the buttons, cards and modals.

What prompt changes improved AI output.

I changed the prompt to ask for HTML and CSS too because it only gave JavaScript at first.
